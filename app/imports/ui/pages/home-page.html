    <p>Looking for a specific plant or want to learn more about a plant that you've seen? Our <a href="{{pathFor 'Plant_Map_Page'}}">INTERACTIVE MAP</a> displays the location of nearby plants and allows you to add plants not yet indentified on the map.  Another great way to use the app is to add plants from your garden at home or even your favorite hike!  Our purpose is to bridge the gaps between people, technology, and nature.  We need plants around in order for us to survive so just "LetUmGrow"!</p>
