      <p>Use the form below to add a plant to the database if you know its latitude and longitude
        coordinates.</p>
      <p>Don't know the coordinates? It's okay, you can press the 'Use current location' button to request your device's current location (if it has location functionality enabled) or just tap a point on the map to use the coordinates at that location.</p>
         <p>Entering the plant's name, scientific name, and description
        is optional.</p>
